14913340-I020000000320001-29af6f4df80c6a0768dd6bf6ebee47a8-1150-2289 because the crowded place is always like is always to make people feel like bad and they get a bad emotion so

15547953-I020000000230001-04c4808c927039be584b053cfa0c215d-5785-7114 but between adults and friends um it is kind of weird to give money as gift
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-0333-0707 well when i was err a little girl
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-0707-1731 i usually received toys um or just a birthday cake as a gift
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-1731-2068 um but when i grow older
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-2068-2724 err i have receives all kinds of other gifts
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-2724-3279 so err the variety is not the same
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-3279-3929 i have err more varieties of gifts

15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-4391-5333 so i guess people tend to err send toys to children not other things
15547953-I020000000230002-dea4d58dce56850bf67a315702fc64e9-5333-5564 but when you grow older

19652364-I000000000290001-ee6fa52108dda257f3653626502b2e7b-0000-0629 yes i like to take pictures when i am travelling

19652364-I000000000290001-ee6fa52108dda257f3653626502b2e7b-1816-2101 when i finish the trip
19652364-I000000000290002-3099bfd38ba24b034dda4cbbeba9edf9-0000-1890 actually i like taking pictures of err many different kinds such as the views or the people i met or um the children or animals
19652364-I000000000290003-fd2cabb1aa79dc86c807e24dec10abd9-0000-0577 err i think taking pictures is quite important
19652364-I000000000290003-fd2cabb1aa79dc86c807e24dec10abd9-0577-1377 because sometimes um pictures is evident for you being somewhere

19652364-I000000000290004-48cdb7dfeb8c5f73b24bbc40730f1110-0000-1323 i think err that's a very good professional job for someone to be a professional photographer
19652364-I000000000290004-48cdb7dfeb8c5f73b24bbc40730f1110-1323-2394 because it um takes professional skills and lot of training to become a professional photographer
19652364-I000000000290005-9d68f0289d3d8035558024addc970345-0000-0969 err i think sometimes err photographer can be an artist
19652364-I000000000290005-9d68f0289d3d8035558024addc970345-0969-1578 if he err use the artist way to take pictures
19652364-I000000000290005-9d68f0289d3d8035558024addc970345-1578-2934 but in many other times err photographer will only record the err the view or the picture of the original things
19652364-I000000000290005-9d68f0289d3d8035558024addc970345-2934-4724 but artist may um have some um artist feeling of the things that is quite different from the things um it looks like
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-0000-0448 ok i want to describe a modern building
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-0448-0965 that is in the olympic park in beijing
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-0965-1328 which is called bird nest um
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-1328-1995 the olympic of beijing in two thousand eight is held in this modern building
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-1995-2284 um as it named shoes
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-2284-2653 the building looks like just like a bird nest
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-2653-3719 and um in the middle of the bird next there is a football ground playground
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-3719-4740 and um a lot of famous singers have place concerts in them
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-4740-5265 i think um this modern building is quite special because
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-5265-5575 of its
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-6166-7660 um firstly it's because it's strange locking it's quite different from the traditional sport medium stadium
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-7660-9345 and secondly because the olympic games into sunlight brings err many precious memories for all the chinese people
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-9345-10338 so this is quite a memorable building for all of us
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-0000-1010 um i think there is quite lots of differences between old buildings and modern buildings
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-1010-1709 the old buildings usually is um two or three floors
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-1709-2024 and modern ones are much higher
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-2024-2920 and um who lived in the old building can get around with the neighbors
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-2920-3802 but who lived in modern buildings won't um even those neighbours living around him
19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-0000-1356 um sometimes um the government buildings is built very modern and expensive
19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-1356-1697 but i think it is not necessary to do so
19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-1697-2573 because um the money used to build this building is from um the tax paders
19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-2573-3410 so i think money should be spend to some place which is more useful to the people
19652364-I020000000730003-9a1c0565030f3f2035bfaf88639f4bff-0000-1263 i think um good architect may combines the utility and good looking
19652364-I020000000730003-9a1c0565030f3f2035bfaf88639f4bff-1263-2386 the building should be err modern and as well as functional
19652364-I020000000730004-3fe3bac73cb208c6fd83760663bc1827-0896-2185 err i think because the chinese person are always fast to learn the new things from other countries

23890883-I000000000140002-71cc0306162f9d0c82cd486f92b36eee-1342-2765 future houses i think err might be smaller more err compact more content and actually use space better though and more officially
23890883-I000000000140003-4737e56354d66758bffad59b8f0b3208-0217-1380 um my wife and i used to share that but now it is mostly done by my mother father law who are living with us cause we had a baby

23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-0000-0650 okay so a website that i
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-0650-1093 ok so website that i often browse um is
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-10132-10926 um it's yeah really popular in across the world even though it's banned in china
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-11695-11997 and yeah so that
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-1179-1894 um you to be in chinese however it's blocked in china so you probably can't get it
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-1894-3081 um it's err basically a sight where any users can post video material and people can watch in common dollar
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-3081-4904 there are similar sights like this in china he see fun bi li bi li however true has very extensive copy right restrictions so most of the content on the true is fairly original or taking
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-5147-6830 um err it's such a big sight and it's so interesting so much different content for anything so um you could really err get lost all day and never see the same thing or the same type of think twice
23890883-I010000000460001-a0b1250de93dd7539042c9756bdda03c-6830-10132 i think the people can make a lot of money from it as well so is actually advertised in a way where are three for people to search and look at the video however if you want to produce videos and your videos can get a lot of searches then advertising on that side can can can some profit for you making it quite interesting idea as a income supplement
23890883-I020000000460001-3d5b07df53ba3437aea85917391be0e3-0493-0893 really gratification reapplication strong as a tool of these things
23890883-I020000000460001-3d5b07df53ba3437aea85917391be0e3-0893-2003 um content changes obviously and the website attracts probably because of the original content then developing changing content is like it to be just attractive
23890883-I020000000460001-3d5b07df53ba3437aea85917391be0e3-2003-2227 so people get used to decide
23890883-I020000000460001-3d5b07df53ba3437aea85917391be0e3-2227-3037 there's also time wasting sights where people know that content shows by so quickly that every day they can see something new
23890883-I020000000460002-3e4f4de5eafb30647a94321003047c10-0230-0316 we think of course
23890883-I020000000460002-3e4f4de5eafb30647a94321003047c10-0377-1396 treating expanding china so not treating is not however some services maybe like wechat moment

23890883-I020000000460002-3e4f4de5eafb30647a94321003047c10-1626-2527 um some of these functions are available and of course yes they are very popular to a so obsessed use
23890883-I020000000460003-715800cf97ad738206c9d4d880df67be-0976-2602 err probably true yourself i think if err people err consider what they ate that day um or not they're wearing that day to be so important to human civilization that they need twitter
23890883-I020000000460003-715800cf97ad738206c9d4d880df67be-2602-2783 err out a picture of it
23890883-I020000000460003-715800cf97ad738206c9d4d880df67be-2783-3224 i think those people basically are offering themselves up to be

25275883-I000000000380004-aa442b6deeb7b37616ce7311a5ad0562-1338-2132 they will be easily influenced by the tv show um or on the programs

25275883-I000000000380004-aa442b6deeb7b37616ce7311a5ad0562-3163-3734 so i don't approve my children to watch tv a lot
25275883-I000000000380005-a75f73823b6a7afd938a12e392447d28-0000-1561 well i think tv advertisement err have to have err two different ways to look at this
25275883-I000000000380005-a75f73823b6a7afd938a12e392447d28-1561-1822 for one one way it is good
25275883-I000000000380005-a75f73823b6a7afd938a12e392447d28-1822-2959 because some famous brand like err p&g and err other good good good things we use today
25275883-I000000000380005-a75f73823b6a7afd938a12e392447d28-2959-3345 err we get to know them by tv advertisement

25275883-I000000000380005-a75f73823b6a7afd938a12e392447d28-4006-4784 and it will err bring wash us and to buy something which is unnecessary at all
25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-0000-0711 i lost a electronic school ten years ago

25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-3099-3564 so it actually means a lot to me
25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-3564-4123 maybe it's not expensive as expensive as a car but
25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-4123-4540 but it had means a lot

25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-5793-6999 so err we can only afford to buy a scotter and i can carry her err all around the town i worked

25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-7786-8593 and we stay there err for and i packed the school in a in at the front game

25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-8976-9875 err we err played and enjoy and reading and read in the park for about two hours
25275883-I010000000290001-637a54a3c08062bb570321aebc872189-9875-10571 but after we finished our err wonderful time being together
25275883-I020000000290001-dada28f5243fb75c0e3b616cff309332-0000-0261 well i am not
25275883-I020000000290001-dada28f5243fb75c0e3b616cff309332-0261-0607 i'm very careful about my belongings
25275883-I020000000290001-dada28f5243fb75c0e3b616cff309332-0607-1072 and err manage them in a very good way
25275883-I020000000290001-dada28f5243fb75c0e3b616cff309332-1072-2176 so i never lololost anything on purpose or without conscious
25275883-I020000000290001-dada28f5243fb75c0e3b616cff309332-2176-2404 actually it's stolen
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-0000-1008 well first i think it's very frustrating for for a person who lose his err belongings
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-1008-1845 because um some no matter it is it mean always means something to us
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-1845-2739 when we lost it it's kind of one part of my of mine has been lost like the school
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-2739-3835 it we um drove them for draw it for almost a year and half as a a wedding gift from my wife
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-3835-4179 so i had a lot feelings for it
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-4179-4761 though even if it become shorter and almost broken down
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-4761-5187 but still it's a special thing for me
25275883-I020000000290002-1c560282614ecfe302ad5e25bc4bbcb3-5187-5756 so i don't like the feeling that i lost something
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-0000-0668 i think for a scooter or a car
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-0668-1500 if it is possible we should err install and gps check on it
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-1500-1978 so even though it is lost we can still check it from the gps
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-1978-3280 and also err i think the parks should place small err parking area for squarters and
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-3280-4008 err the government should err send more people to watch over this
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-4008-5283 because err there are some people who might need need scooter or maybe some are just burgers
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-5283-6056 so i think err people the place err should have more petrol on the street
25275883-I020000000290003-2201a41549faea04ae392e239e46ac9a-6056-7211 and um they can um it make sure no safe will stole any useful things in the day time
25275883-I020000000290004-bb61c759a44794bc8be0a7e2afabbe7b-0000-0633 well i think first for those who usually um lose things
25275883-I020000000290004-bb61c759a44794bc8be0a7e2afabbe7b-0633-1019 they should be aware of themselves err
