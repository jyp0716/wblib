19652364-I000000000290005-9d68f0289d3d8035558024addc970345-0000-0969	 um i think sometimes um photographer can be an artist

19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-2653-3719	 and um in middle of the bird nest there is a football ground playground
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-3719-4740	 and a lot of famous singers have played concerts in them

19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-5265-5575	 because of its
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-6166-7660	 firstly it's because its strange looking is quite different from the traditional sports medium stadium
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-7660-9345	 and secondly because the olympic games in two thousand and eight bring many precious memory for all the chinese people
19652364-I010000000730001-9d20355c1c85846c130b8fb57f1b3ffa-9345-10338	 so this is quite a memorable building for all of us
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-0000-1010	 um i think there are quite a lot of differences between the old buildings and the modern buildings
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-1010-1709	 the old buildings usually is um two or three floors
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-1709-2024	 and modern ones are much higher
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-2024-2920	 and um who lived in the old building can get around with the neighbors
19652364-I020000000730001-a480c10b3d89e5d90f30ac463ad63998-2920-3802	 but who lived in the modern buildings won't um even knows neighbors living around him
19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-0000-1356	 um sometimes err the government buildings is built very modern and expensive

19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-1697-2573	 because err the money used to build those buildings is from err the tax payers
19652364-I020000000730002-81937019dfd97a7670c20c49fe198bff-2573-3410	 so i think this money should be spent to some place which is more useful to the people
19652364-I020000000730003-9a1c0565030f3f2035bfaf88639f4bff-0000-1263	 i think a good architect may combines the utility and good looking

25275883-I020000000290004-bb61c759a44794bc8be0a7e2afabbe7b-1564-1958	 when they lost something they will be in trouble
25275883-I020000000290004-bb61c759a44794bc8be0a7e2afabbe7b-1958-2344	 for example if you lose your id card
